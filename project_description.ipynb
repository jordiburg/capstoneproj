    "      - Provide appropriate metrics and visuals to support the conclusions\n",
    "  - Mention reproducibility on AzureML if applies\n",
    "  - What needs to be improved based on products (is it price reduction? is it product packaging? quite tricky to determine). Focus more on basic trend analysis, perhaps based on year and simpler stuff (basic visual analysis)."
