    "# Capstone Project: Fine Foods Reviews Analysis and Sentiment Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fine Foods Reviews Analysis and Sentiment Classification project aims to analyze the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, which consists of reviews for fine foods from Amazon. The project focuses on exploring the dataset, performing sentiment analysis, and building a machine learning model for sentiment classification. By working on this project, students will gain practical experience in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualization, natural language processing, deep learning, parameter tuning, and Azure ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset\n",
    "- Number of reviews: 568,454\n",
    "- Number of users: 256,059\n",
    "- Number of products: 74,258\n",
    "- Timespan: Oct 1999 - Oct 2012\n",
    "- Number of Attributes/Columns in data: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many business questions can be answered by analyzing this dataset. Assume that our clients wants to get the answer to the following questions and potential data-driven approach to answer the questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question**: How do customers feel about our products and brands?\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Customer sentiment analysis provides insights into areas of improvement or customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question**: Can we predict how customers will rate our products based on their reviews?\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Review rating prediction provides insights into customer preferences and helps assess product performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question**: How can we identify emerging trends in customer opinions and forecast future preferences?\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Trend analysis and forecasting help understand changes in customer preferences and anticipate future trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be working on the above quesitons answering the business problems. \n",
